4. Game Rules

  In order to leave each level it is necessary to own five keys and also
  to have a free way to the exit.

  You will be meeting miscellaneous game elements while completing individual
  missions, we will try to explain their meaning now.

  Box             - It is possible to push it.
  Explosive       - Can destroy the boxes.

  Key             - You need five of them.
  Exit            - A gate to next level.

  Stone           - Can be broken by a pickax.
  Pickax          - A tool for stone crushing.

  Color key       - Used to unlock color door, only a bug with identical 
                    color can pick them up.
  Color door      - Can be opened by the respective color key only.

  Color gate-way  - Only a bug with identical color is allowed to go
                    through. Boxes cannot be pushed through.

  One-pass door   - Can be used only once, then they close them off 
                    and there's no way to open them.

  Other elements not listed here are just walls, which have no interesting
  properties. They cannot be push away nor it is possible 
  to break them anywise.
